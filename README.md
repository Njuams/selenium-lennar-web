**Selenium Python GitHub Repository**

This repository contains a Selenium Python project that you can use to automate web browser interactions. This README will guide you through the installation process and provide instructions for running the main script.
Installation

To get started, please follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

    Install Python on your machine. You can download and install Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/). Alternatively, you can install Python from the Microsoft Store if you are using Windows.
Note: The project was developed using Python version 3.11.4. Ensure that you have a compatible Python version installed.

Create a virtual environment (venv) for the project. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory. Then run the following command:

bash

python -m venv env

This will create a virtual environment named "env" in the project directory.

Activate the virtual environment. Depending on your operating system, the command to activate the virtual environment will differ:

Windows (Command Prompt):

    env\Scripts\activate.bat

Windows (PowerShell):

    .\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1

macOS/Linux:

    source myenv/bin/activate

Install the required dependencies. While inside the virtual environment, run the following command to install the necessary packages:

bash

    pip install pytest selenium

This will install the PyTest and Selenium packages required for running the project.

Running the Project

After completing the installation steps, you're ready to run the main script. Make sure you are still inside the virtual environment.

In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's root directory.

Run the following command to execute the main.py script:


    python main.py

The script will start executing, and you will see the browser automation in action.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and executed the Selenium Python project from this repository. Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and adapt it to suit your needs. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please don't hesitate to open an issue on the repository page. Happy automation!
